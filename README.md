# Developer Course
Fast track course to becoming a JavaScript developer

Welcome. I've been seeing a few people wanting to get started with programming but not really knowing how to begin.
In order to speed up the process, I thought I'd provide a step by step guide.

Initially, this guide will make a few jarring jumps because I find a lot of courses too wordy, and I'm going to start too basic and build up.
If you have any specific questions or areas you would like more explanation about, feel free to create an issue.
I might expand my explanation or point you to external resources.

Remember, this guide is highly opinionated to make the process as fast as possible.
I will be following my own guide and my project will be this course. Dogfooding from the start.
Hold onto your hats! Here we go!
